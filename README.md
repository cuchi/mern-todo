## To-Do Node.js application
This is a simple example of a Node.js application using the MERN stack (like MEAN, but using React instead).

**Why a To-Do application?**
Because it needs to be small and yet show some nice perspective of what MERN stack is about.

### Installing
Clone this repository first, then run:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```
Now it should be listening in `http://localhost:8000` by default.

### What are we using?
- **MongoDB** *via Mongoose*: data storage
- **Express** *with body-parser & morgan*: RESTful API
- **BlueBird** because promises are awesome
- **Passport**: user authentication
- **Xo** to keep the code clean
- **Babel**: cutting-edge features of ECMAScript 6
- **React** to build reusable components
- **Immutable-js**: to handle with immutable data
- **Material-Ui**: good-looking material design components, in react!

*Work in progress*! there is a lot of good stuff to put in this list.
