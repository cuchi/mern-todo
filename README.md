## To-Do Node.js application
This is a simple example of a Node.js application using the MERN stack (like MEAN, but using React instead).

**Why a To-Do application?**
Because it needs to be small and yet show some nice perspective of what MERN stack is about.

### What am I using?
- **MongoDB** *via Mongoose* for storing data
- **Express** *with body-parser & morgan* for the HTTP API
- **BlueBird** because promises are awesome
- **Xo** to keep the code clean
*Work in progress*! there is a lot of good stuff to put in this list.
